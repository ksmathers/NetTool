NetTool
=======

This is a tiny systray tool for turning the web proxy on or off wihtout having to open the Internet Settings dialog

When moving my laptop between office and home I find myself either enabling or disabling the web proxy settings twice a day.
This tool simplifies that process by providing a task tray icon context menu that enables or disables the proxy, showing the
current state of the proxy setting when the context menu is opened.

The application is standalone and can be run without the need for installation.
